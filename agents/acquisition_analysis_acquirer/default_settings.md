## Input handling contract

- Apply defaults before prompt construction. Resolve an omitted valuation date to the research cut-off date, not the run date.
- Preserve "Unknown" and "Not available" as supplied; do not silently replace them with facts or client preferences.
- All question-list fields must be inserted into this agent's prompt. A separate question-list document alone does not affect research.
- Listed documents require actual runtime access; this schema does not implement file upload.
- The runtime validates the reviewed content interface. ATL registration remains pending.
